	<LongDescription>## MAGIC HEARSE REDUX

## No More DeathWaves!

- Is your city overrun with hearses and annoying hearse notifications?
- This mod removes death in your cities.
- No death = no crematoriums, cemeteries, or hearses clogging up the roads.

Citizens will magically disappear upon death.

## Features
- Works automatically - just install the mod and enable the checkbox in Options.
- Silent operation: enable/disable without restarting your game.
- Does not use Harmony or Reflection (increases reliability on game patch days).
- Works with new and existing saves.
- Safe to remove any time
- Make sure to **remove** all other Hearse/Deathcare mods to avoid conflicts

## Outcomes

Hearse drivers out of job seek employment in the shipping industry.
