	<LongDescription>## Magic Hearse (Redux)

## No More Death-Waves!

- Is your city clogged with hearses and annoying hearse notifications?
- This mod removes dead bodies; no need for  crematoriums, or traffic from hearse cars.
- Citizens will magically disappear upon death.

## Features
- Just install the mod (keep the checkbox enabled in Options)
- Automatic: enable/disable without restarting the game.
- Remove all other Hearse/Deathcare mods to avoid conflicts!!
- This mod does not use Harmony or Reflection (increases reliability on game patch days).
- Safe to remove any time. Works with new and existing saves.
- Keep the cemeteries for the looks, just know that MHR has you covered.

## Credits
- River-Mochi - author and maintainer
- Thanks to Wayze, the original author of Magical Hearse (new mod made with Wayze's blessing)
- Necko1996 - testing, screenshots

## How it works
- If the citizen is flagged as dead and needs transport, it's cleaned up. Looks like magic but the secret is flags. 
Mod does not stop death - it's just very fast corpse cleanup.
- Great for your next zombie apocalypse.
