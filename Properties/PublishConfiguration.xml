	<LongDescription>## MAGIC HEARSE REDUX

## No More DeathWaves!
Are you managing a large city that is overrun with hearses and those annoying hearse notifications?
This mod removes death in your cities. No death = no crematoriums, cemetaries, or hearses cloggin up the roads.

Citizens will magically disappear upon death.

## How it works:
Works automatically - just install the mod and enable the checkbox in Options.
- Silent operation: enable/disable without restarting your game.
- Does not use Harmony or Reflection (increases reliability on game patch days).
- Works with new and existing saves.
- Safe to remove any time

## What is the Secret Sauce?
- Selection: scans citizen entities with both flags dead and requires transport and safely vanishes them.
- Performance: designed to update less frequently with parallel jobs.

## Outcomes: Hearse drivers out of job seek employment in the shipping industry.

## Added Languages: French, Spanish, German, Simple Chinese
