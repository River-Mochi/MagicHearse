# Magical Hearse
 
This mod removes the need to place deathcare buildings (crematorium, cemetery) in your city! No more hearses, and no more "Waiting for Hearse" notifications!

Instead of needing to be transported to the creamorium or cemetery, the citizens will now magically disappear upon death.

This mod works with new and existing saves (may take a few seconds to kick in on existing saves).
